Q1. The predicutive model which i am building i am using linear regresstion, lasso, ridge, elasticnet. Let's know What are these..!!
->  1️⃣ Linear Regression
This is the most basic and simple regression technique. The model draws a straight line that best fits the data, helping us make predictions.

📌 Example:
If we look at the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales, as the temperature increases, ice cream sales also increase. 
Linear Regression will draw a straight line to predict this trend.

2️⃣ Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
Lasso is an upgraded version of Linear Regression. It removes unimportant variables (features) by setting them to zero, making the model simpler and cleaner.

📌 Example:
If you're building a house price prediction model and your dataset has 100 features (like area, rooms, location, parking, etc.), 
Lasso will keep only the important features and set the rest to zero.

3️⃣ Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
Ridge is also an improved version of Linear Regression, but it does not remove features. Instead, it makes their impact smaller by reducing their coefficients.
This helps solve the overfitting problem.

📌 Example:
If you're predicting student marks based on attendance, study hours, and extra activities, but your model is overfitting (performing well on training data but failing on new data), 
Ridge will adjust the coefficients to make the model generalize better.

4️⃣ ElasticNet Regression
ElasticNet is a combination of Lasso and Ridge. This means it can remove unimportant features (like Lasso) and also control the impact of remaining features (like Ridge).

📌 Example:
If you're building a medical model to predict diseases in patients, and your dataset has many features, ElasticNet will automatically use the best approach to ensure accurate
predictions.

💡 TL;DR (Quick Summary)
✅ Linear Regression – Just fits a straight line to the data.
✅ Lasso Regression – Removes unnecessary features (sets them to zero).
✅ Ridge Regression – Doesn’t remove features, but reduces their impact.
✅ ElasticNet Regression – A mix of Lasso & Ridge (best of both).
